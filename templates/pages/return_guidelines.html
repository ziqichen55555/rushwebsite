                <div class="mt-3">
                    <h5 class="border-bottom pb-2 mb-3">Advance Confirmation</h5>
                    <p>If you plan to return the car outside of business hours, confirm in advance with the rental company whether after-hours returns are allowed at your specific location.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="border-bottom pb-2 mb-3">Return Procedure</h5>
                    <p>If permitted, you will typically need to park the car in a designated area, lock it securely, and document the vehicle's condition.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="border-bottom pb-2 mb-3">Documentation</h5>
                    <p>Record the fuel level, mileage, and vehicle exterior condition by taking clear, time-stamped photos (make sure the camera's timestamp feature is enabled). This documentation is crucial for your protection.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="border-bottom pb-2 mb-3">Key Return</h5>

                    <h5 class="border-bottom pb-2 mb-3">Risk Awareness</h5>
                    <p>Please note that you remain responsible for any risks that occur between the time you return the car and the next business day when our staff can properly inspect the vehicle.</p>

                <div class="mt-3">
                    <h5 class="border-bottom pb-2 mb-3">No Smoking Policy</h5>
                    <p>All our vehicles are strictly non-smoking. If evidence of smoking is found in the vehicle, you will be charged a cleaning fee of up to $250 to restore the vehicle to its smoke-free condition.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="border-bottom pb-2 mb-3">Cleanliness Standards</h5>
                    <p>Please return the vehicle in a reasonably clean condition. Excessive dirt or stains may result in additional cleaning charges.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="border-bottom pb-2 mb-3">Damage Reporting</h5>
                    <p>Any damage that occurred during your rental period should be reported at the time of return. Attempting to conceal damage may result in additional fees and complications with insurance claims.</p>

                    <h5 class="border-bottom pb-2 mb-3">Full-to-Full Policy</h5>
                    <p>If your rental agreement specifies a "full-to-full" fuel policy, you must return the vehicle with a full tank of fuel. Please retain the fuel receipt from a gas station within 5 km of the return location, as our staff may request this receipt to verify that the tank was properly filled.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="border-bottom pb-2 mb-3">Electric Vehicles</h5>
                    <p>For electric vehicles, you don't need to return them fully charged. The rental company will assess the battery level upon return and may apply a reasonable charging fee based on the current battery percentage.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="border-bottom pb-2 mb-3">Refueling Charges</h5>
                    <p>If you fail to refill the tank as required by your rental agreement, we will charge a refueling fee plus the cost of the missing fuel at a premium rate.</p>

                <div class="mt-3">
                    <h5 class="border-bottom pb-2 mb-3">Document Retention</h5>
                    <p>After returning the car, keep all contracts and receipts until the deposit is fully refunded to your credit card. This documentation is essential if any disputes arise regarding your rental.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="border-bottom pb-2 mb-3">Deposit Return Timeline</h5>
                    <p>If there are no traffic violations or additional charges during the rental period, the deposit will generally be unfrozen and returned to the main driver's credit card within 30 days of return.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="border-bottom pb-2 mb-3">Additional Charges</h5>
                    <p>If there are additional charges during the rental period (such as traffic violations, tolls, or parking fees), they may be deducted from your deposit before the remainder is returned to you.</p>
